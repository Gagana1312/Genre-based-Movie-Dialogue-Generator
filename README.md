# Genre-based Movie Dialog Generator

## Project Overview
This project was conducted from May 2023 to August 2023 in collaboration with Northeastern University. It focuses on the effective analysis of text generation models leading to the development of a Genre-based Movie Dialog Generator. The goal is to leverage complex neural network architectures like Seq2seq models, Bidirectional LSTM, GRU, and GPT2LMHeadModel to generate movie dialogues that are genre-specific.

## Objectives
- **Model Development**: Use advanced machine learning models to generate dialogues that capture the essence of different movie genres.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implement K-Fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the models.
- **Training Regimen**: Establish a 30-epoch training protocol to demonstrate AI's potential in creative writing across various film genres.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Natural Language Processing (NLP), TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Tools**: GitHub for version control, and various data structures to manage the model data efficiently.

## Setup and Installation
**Clone the Repository, install the requirements, and run the ipynb files**:
```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/GenreBasedMovieDialogGenerator.git
```
## Model Details
- **Seq2Seq Models**: Used for understanding the conversation context.
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Helps capture context from past and future input sequences.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)**: Used for simpler yet efficient sequence modeling.
- **GPT2LMHeadModel**: Fine-tuned to generate dialogues that are not only coherent but also genre-specific.

## Results and Evaluation
The project employs K-Fold cross-validation to ensure that the models are generalizable and perform well across different datasets. Preliminary results have shown promising potential in using AI for creative dialogue generation in films.
